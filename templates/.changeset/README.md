# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/master/docs/common-questions.md)

## @jakzo/project instructions

-   This file and `config.json` are both automatically generated -- **DO NOT MODIFY THEM!**
-   You will need to install the changesets bot if you haven't previously: https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot
-   You will need to [create an npm token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens) and [add it to your repository as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) with the name `NPM_TOKEN` (note also that 2FA must be disabled on publish for the token)
